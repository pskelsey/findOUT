1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

Verify that version 9.8 (R2020a) of the MATLAB Runtime is installed.   
If not, you can run the MATLAB Runtime installer.
To find its location, enter
  
    >>mcrinstaller
      
at the MATLAB prompt.
NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run the MATLAB Runtime installer. 

Alternatively, download and install the Windows version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2020a 
from the following link on the MathWorks website:

    https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html

Alternatvely, you can use the file findOUT_And_Runtime.exe to install the app and
the correct version of Runtime.
   
For more information about the MATLAB Runtime and the MATLAB Runtime installer, see 
"Distribute Applications" in the MATLAB Compiler documentation  
in the MathWorks Documentation Center.
